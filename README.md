Submarine Game
==============

Taking a look into the Starling framework for assigning certain tasks to the GPU for better performance. This project is pretty barebones and is not utilizing a game framework like Citrus etc... The point is mainly to get comfortable with setting animation sequences from sprite sheets and attempting smooth parallax scrolling with higher resolution bitmaps. 

Dependencies
------------

- Flash / Air
- Starling Framework
