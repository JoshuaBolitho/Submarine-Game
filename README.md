starling_test_01
================

Taking a look into the Starling framework for assigning certain tasks to the GPU for better performance. This project is pretty barebones and is not utilizing a game framework like Citrus etc... The point is mainly to get comfortable with setting animation sequences from sprite sheets and attempting smooth parallax scrolling with higher resolution bitmaps.

Have not yet finished or refactored and quite possibly never will.
